# r/Soccer DAO to buy a Soccer Team and promote it to Premier League

Deployed Link of this App: https://r-soccer-dao-5tkmznty0-asfandyar-malik.vercel.app/

This is a DAO through which 3.1 million subscribers of r/soccer get to buy a team together, decide unanimously on every transfer decision, club direction and get the team promoted. The rules of governance are determined on voting contract. 

It is a way to let people vote on stuff, automatically count up those votes, and then any member would be able to execute the proposal on-chain. All without any central party (No kroenkes, glazers or sheikhs). 

The goal is to take a team from 2nd, 3rd division and promote it to English Premier League.

5. `node scripts/5-deploy-token.js`

We deploy a standard ERC-20 token contract which is the standard for all the massive coins on Ethereum adopt. Our Token symbol is BALLONDOR ... hahaha you can get more Ballon d'or than Ronaldo and Messi ;) 

You can see the token module here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x4377b0EE22245A77b798A59121501d13BE80Ec85

Import the token in your metamask wallet:

We officially have our own token !! 


6. ðŸ’¸ Create your tokenâ€™s supply.

`node scripts/6-print-money.js`

I set it up to 1 million here :)

7. Now we airdrop the token 

`node scripts/7-airdrop-token.js`

Here you can visualize the holders of my token:

On our website we show the list of all token owners:

8. Deploy a governance contract for the whole DAO

`node scripts/8-deploy-vote.js`

We have very few governance rules: 
* Can only vote with BALLONDOR token
* Member have to vote within 24 hours of a proposal
* Quorum is currently 0, so anyone can decide :) 

Vote Module deployed here:  
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9820eE959FeE2bA3f498825e0FC24f1BC08B7B97


9. Distribute tokens to contract, to get rid of my wallet owning most of the supply ;): 

Here transferring 90% of supply to voting contract. 

You can see it there: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9820ee959fee2ba3f498825e0fc24f1bc08b7b97

10. Create new proposals which could be voted upon on. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4105873/147492466-8120c776-8075-4650-9b0e-8dc0b2419b6a.png)

Run this command 'node scripts/10-create-vote-proposals.js'


11. Revoke the minting rights on ERC-20 contract, otherwise one can practically create millions of more tokens and shock the DAO. Revoking access saves us from  admin takeover :).

Fascinating, you can now see our token, trade it on Uniswap: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap which is a decentralized exchange.

Final Words: 

A quick overview on what has been accomplished:

âœ… deployed your own custom ERC-20 token
âœ… deployed your own ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join your DAO.
âœ… deployed your own governance contract + treasury.
âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your governance contract.

We just created a full-fledged DAO. The only things regarding DAO, which are did not cover so far are tokenomics, running an actual community, planning your DAOs roadmap, etc
