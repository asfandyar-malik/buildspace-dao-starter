# r/Soccer DAO to buy a Soccer Team and promote it to Premier League

This is a DAO through which 3.1 million subscribers of r/soccer get to buy a team together, decide unanimously on every transfer decision, club direction and get the team promoted. The rules of governance are determined on a smart contract, so everything is completely transparent.   

The goal is to take a team from 2nd, 3rd division and promote it to English Premier League.
